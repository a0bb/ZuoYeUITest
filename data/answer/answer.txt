My younger brother Daniel and I went to visit our uncle last Sunday. We were riding along a hillside (then)>[when] some big stones (were)* rolled down and knocked us off our bikes. Daniel's legs got seriously hurt (but)>[and] so did mine. We couldn't move a bit. (Fortunate)>[Fortunately] enough, we saw some farmers working in the fields nearby. Waving our (hand)>[hands], we cried for help like crazy. On hearing us, they (run)>[ran] to the spot as fast as possible. Thanks (for)>[to] their help, we were (all)>[both] sent to a nearby hospital and received medical treatment in time. We can't convey how grateful we are (to)^[the] kind farmers! From this experience, we are firmly (convincing)>[convinced] that the world is full of warmth.
